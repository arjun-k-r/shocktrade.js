        <p>According to <b>CNN Money</b>: "<span class="st_green">Wall Street welcomed millennials to the world of investing by showing them the scariest financial crisis
        since the Great Depression</span>" (Egan, 2015).</p>

        Millennials, according to a <b>Bankrate.com</b> survey (Tuchman, 2015):
        <ul>
            <li>Roughly 1 in 4 (26%) own stocks</li>
            <li>Of those that don’t invest, the reasons are both compelling and frustrating.</li>
            <li>More than half (53%) said they don’t have the money to invest.</li>
            <li><span class="st_green">One in five (21%) said they don’t know enough about stocks to invest.</span></li>
        </ul>

        According to a <b>Capital One</b> ShareBuilder survey:
        "<span class="st_green">93% of millennials say that both distrust of markets and lack of
        investing knowledge make them less confident about investing</span>," (Palmer, 2014) which represents a large potential consumer market for
        investment products that allow them to experiment with the market without risking their capital (Sources:
